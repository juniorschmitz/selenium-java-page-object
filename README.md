# Selenium, Java and JUnit using PageObjects

On this project were used Selenium Webdriver along with Java and JUnit, and applying the PageObjects pattern looking for a more suitable way for developing and reading the implemented tests.

Also, some DataDriven pattern was implemented too, just as a example where we can use it for developing tests in a more efficient way.

Hope it helps as a sample project for starting developing tests.
